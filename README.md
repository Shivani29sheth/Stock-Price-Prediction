# Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Linear Regression (LR), and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. <br />
<br />
Machine learning models can be useful tools in predicting stock prices of a given company. Accurate predictions of a company's future stock price could yield significant profits for an entity. In this project, we use 17 year's of IBM stock price data to predict and evaluate its stock price in the last 3 years. The prices are predicted using machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Long Short-Term Memory Networks, and Autoregressive integrated moving average(ARIMA) models, and a comparison is made between the working and results of each model. The results show that the prices were most accurately predicted by the ARIMA model with a root mean squared error of 0.05, followed by LSTM with a root mean squared error of 1. Linear Regression performs the worst among all three models with a root mean squared error of 51. <br />

First, let us see the actual test values plotted on the graph: <br />
